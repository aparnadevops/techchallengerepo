## Basics

> General

1. What is the role of AWS/Azure/GCP in DevOps?
    DevOps Tooling by AWS. AWS provides services that help you practice DevOps at your company and that are built first for use with AWS. These tools automate manual tasks, help     teams manage complex environments at scale, and keep engineers in control of the high velocity that is enabled by DevOps.
2. How will you approach a project that needs to implement DevOps?
    Create a Competent Team.
	  Start with Small Initiatives.
	  Follow Agile Principles.
	  Prepare the Environment.
	  Customer Feedback.
    
3. Mention some of the core benefits of DevOps.
  Reduce the implementation time of new services from months to minutes
  Increase productivity of business and IT teams
  Save costs on maintenance and upgrades, and eliminate unnecessary capital expenditure
  Standardize processes for easy replication and faster delivery
  Improve quality, reliability and reusability of all system components
  Increase the rate of success for digitalization strategies and transformation projects
  Ensure that money invested in cloud infrastructure, analytics and data management are not w
 
 
4. What are the different phases in DevOps?
    Test
  	Build
	  code
	  plan
	  monitor
	  operate
	  deploy
  	Relese
	
5. Explain the concept of branching in Git.
    Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems. ... Instead of copying files from directory to directory, Git stores a branch as a reference to a       commit. In this sense, a branch represents the tip of a series of commitsâ€”it's not a container for commits.
	
6. What is a merge conflict in Git, and how can it be resolved?
   A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. When all the changes in the code occur on          different lines or in different files, Git will successfully merge commits without your help.
  
  Under your repository name, click Pull requests.
  In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request with a merge conflict that you'd like to resolve.
  Near the bottom of your pull request, click Resolve conflicts.
     


> Security
1. What is DDoS attack? How do you deal with it?
    A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its          surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.
	
2. What are the benefits of having Policy management?
    provide workers with knowledge about what is expected of them, e.g. behaviour and performance standards;
    provide rules and guidelines for decision-making in routine situations;
    provide a consistent and clear response across the company in dealing with situations


3. How HTTPS is different from HTTP?
    HTTPS is HTTP with encryption. The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. ... A website that       uses HTTP has http:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has https://.
	
4. What TCP and UDP vulnerabilities are you familiar with?
    By exploiting the holes, malicious hackers could cause TCP sessions to end prematurely, creating a "denial of service," or DOS attack. The TCP vulnerability could also           disrupt communications between routers on the Internet by interrupting BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) sessions that use TCP, NISCC said.
  	A UDP amplification vulnerability occurs when a UDP service responds with more data or packets than the initial request that elicited the response(s).
	
5. Explain OAuth
    OAuth doesn't share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers. OAuth is an authentication protocol         that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password.
	
6. What types of firewalls are there?
    Packet-filtering firewalls.
    Circuit-level gateways.
    Stateful inspection firewalls. 
    Application-level gateways (a.k.a. proxy firewalls)
    Next-gen firewalls.
    Software firewalls.
    Hardware firewalls.
    Cloud firewalls.
